# omnitool
a tool that automatically takes screenshots in the background, OCRs them, and stores them. It then allows to search inside those screenshots
See here for vision and ideas for future development: https://twitter.com/verbine/status/1256598690770411521

the file omnitool_capture.py is the file that should run in the background, captures the data and builds the database
the file omnitool_search.py is the file that searches the database

NOTE: This is a very rough prototype. It's badly-written and not productized. But it does show how to build a tool like this.

Remarks for each file can be found inside the file.
